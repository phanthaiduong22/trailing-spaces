# trailing-spaces

## Synopsis

<!-- Plugin description -->
Jetbrains provides a way to automate deletion of trailing spaces in setting. Depending on your settings, it may be more handy to just highlight them and/or delete them by hand, at any time. This plugin provides just that, and a lot of options to fine-tune the way you want to decimate trailing spaces.

## Usage

### Delete

The main feature you gain from using this plugin is that of deleting all trailing spaces in the currently edited document. In order to use this deletion feature, you may either:

1. **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` (or `Cmd+Shift+A` on Mac) and select/type "Trailing Spaces: Delete"

2. **Keyboard Shortcut**: The plugin comes with a default keyboard shortcut `Alt+Shift+T` to delete all trailing spaces at once in the current file!

3. **Menu**: Access the action from the "Edit" menu where "Trailing Spaces: Delete" is available

With these options, you can quickly delete all trailing spaces in your current document whenever needed!
