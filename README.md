# trailing-spaces

<!-- Plugin description -->
Jetbrains provides a way to automate deletion of trailing spaces in setting. Depending on your settings, it may be more handy to just highlight them and/or delete them by hand, at any time. This plugin provides just that, and a lot of options to fine-tune the way you want to decimate trailing spaces.
